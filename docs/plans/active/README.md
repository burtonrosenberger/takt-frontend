## In Progress

### UI Redesign

**Status**: Started (commit `af2c343 start redesign`)

The app is transitioning from the original horizontal-scroll layout (`Home.vue`) to a new card-based design (`NewHome.vue`). The current `[id].vue` page references the redesigned component.

**What's changing**:
- Layout moving from full-width horizontal sections to a structured card grid
- Visual hierarchy being reworked
- Component composition being simplified

**Open questions**:
- Extent of redesign across child components (Survey, Game, Participate, Projects)
- Whether `Home.vue` will be removed or retained as a fallback
